# Input Map

An input manager and utilities for JavaScript/Typescript and React apps.

Manage multiple devices (keyboard, gamepad, touch, etc) and assign input mappings (e.g. "Jump" = "Spacebar"). Use React components to add device support (`<GamepadInput>`).

Inspired by [the Unity input mapping system.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html)

> This library is WIP and **not intended for production** yet. See Roadmap for more info.

## How to use

`npm i input-map`
